1. model 
a simple svm model 
using the bags of word model to generate the feature vectors 
Improving: add bigram features 

- criterion: binary classification: accuracy, precision, recall, f1score
confusion matrix -- useless 

2. preprocessing 
(1) ignore the tags First
(2) introducing the tages: assign much higher weigths for the tages words
